# Mathematical optimization

## (mathy math)
optimization problem has form
$$
\begin{array}{ll} \mbox{minimize} & f_0(x)\\
\mbox{subject to} & f_i(x) \leq 0, \quad i=1,\ldots,m
\end{array}
$$

- $x\in \reals^n$ is \textbf{decision variable} (to be found)
- $f_0$ is objective function; $f_i$ are constraint functions
- problem data are hid inside $f_0,\ldots, f_m$
- variations: 
add equality constraints,
maximize a utility function, 
satisfaction (feasibility),
optimal trade off
